# Unit tests for the Chess logic project

Currently includes unit tests mainly for Piece actions such as:
- Move
- Capture
- Pawn Promotion
- En passant
- Castling

Definitely does not yet fully cover the logic of a fully-featured chess game. <br>
Many tests situations such as:
- Check and Checkmate
- Awarded points
- All cases for pawn promotion
- Actually performing an action and validating the new board state

Are not yet covered in any of the written tests.
